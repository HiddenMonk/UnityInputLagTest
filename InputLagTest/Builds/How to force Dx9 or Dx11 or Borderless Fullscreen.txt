To force dx9 or dx11 Graphics api to be used you need to..
1 - Create a shortcut of the InputLagText.exe
2 - Right click the shortcut and go to properties
3 - In the "Shortcut" tab, there should be a "Target" field that has something like this inside
"C:\Users\SomeName\Desktop\InputLagTest\InputLagTest.exe"
To force a graphics api, just apply either of the below to the end of that "Target" field text.

To force dx11 = -force-d3d11
To force dx9 = -force-d3d9

So, if you wanted to force dx11 (which should be on be default anyways), you would do...
"C:\Users\SomeName\Desktop\InputLagTest\InputLagTest.exe -force-d3d11"

and to force dx9, you would do...
"C:\Users\SomeName\Desktop\InputLagTest\InputLagTest.exe -force-d3d9"

The reason I cant just do this for you is because the shortcuts are not relative to their folder, so the shortcuts I make might not work for you.



By default the game will run in "Exclusive Fullscreen" mode. Exclusive fullscreen should show less input lag then borderless fullscreen.
If you want to run in "Fullscreen Windowed" mode (also known as borderless window), then use the command...

Borderless = -window-mode borderless
Exclusive = -window-mode exclusive

So it will look like 
"C:\Users\SomeName\Desktop\InputLagTest\InputLagTest.exe -window-mode borderless"
